		<h2 id="image-builder-features">Features of Image Builder </h2>
		<p>EC2 Image Builder provides the following features:</p>
		<p><b>Increase productivity and reduce operations for building
				compliant and up-to-date images</b></p>
		<p>Image Builder reduces the amount of work involved in creating and managing images at scale by
			automating your build pipelines. You can automate your builds by providing your build
			execution schedule preference. Automation reduces the operational cost of maintaining
			your software with the latest operating system patches.</p>
		<p><b>Increase service uptime</b></p>
		<p>Image Builder provides access to test components that you can use to test your images before
			deployment. You can also create custom test components with AWS Task Orchestrator and Executor (AWSTOE), and use
			those. Image Builder distributes your image only if all of the configured tests have
			succeeded.</p>
		<p><b>Raise the security bar for deployments</b></p>
		<p>Image Builder allows you to create images that remove unnecessary exposure to component
			security vulnerabilities. You can apply AWS security settings to create secure,
			out-of-the-box images that meet industry and internal security criteria. Image Builder also
			provides collections of settings for companies in regulated industries. You can use
			these settings to help you quickly and easily build compliant images for STIG standards.
			For a complete list of STIG components available through Image Builder, see <a href="./ib-stig.html">Amazon managed STIG hardening components for Image Builder</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Centralized enforcement and lineage tracking</b></p>
		<p>Using built-in integrations with AWS Organizations, Image Builder enables you to enforce policies that
			restrict accounts to run instances only from approved AMIs.</p>
		<p><b>Simplified sharing of resources across
			AWS accounts</b></p>
		<p>EC2 Image Builder integrates with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to allow you to share certain resources
			with any AWS account or through AWS Organizations. EC2 Image Builder resources that can be shared
			are:</p>

		<h2 id="image-builder-image-formats">Supported image formats</h2>
		<p>For your custom images that create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), you can choose an existing 
			AMI as a starting point. For Docker container images, you can choose from public images hosted 
			on DockerHub, existing container images in Amazon ECR, or Amazon-managed container images as your 
			starting point.</p>

		<h2 id="image-builder-concepts">Concepts</h2>
		<p>The following terms and concepts are central to your understanding and use of
			EC2 Image Builder.</p>
		 
			<h6>AMI</h6>
			<p>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is the basic unit of deployment in Amazon EC2, and is one
				of the types of images you can create with Image Builder. An AMI is a pre-configured virtual
				machine image that contains the operating system (OS) and preinstalled software to
				deploy EC2 instances. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html">Amazon Machine Images
					(AMI)</a>.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Image pipeline</h6>
			<p>An image pipeline provides an automation framework for building secure AMIs and
				container images on AWS. The Image Builder image pipeline is associated with an image
				recipe or container recipe that defines the build, validation, and test phases for
				an image build lifecycle.</p>
		 
		<p>An image pipeline can be associated with an infrastructure configuration that defines
			where your image is built. You can define attributes, such as instance type, subnets,
			security groups, logging, and other infrastructure-related configurations. You can also
			associate your image pipeline with a distribution configuration to define how you would
			like to deploy your image. </p>
		
		 
			<h6>Managed image</h6>
			<p>A managed image is a resource in Image Builder that consists of an AMI or container image,
				plus metadata, such as version and platform. The managed image is used by Image Builder
				pipelines to determine which base image to use for the build. In this guide, managed
				images are sometimes referred to as "images," however, an image is not the same as
				an AMI.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Image recipe</h6>
			<p>An Image Builder image recipe is a document that defines the base image and the components
				that are applied to the base image to produce the desired configuration for the
				output AMI image. You can use an image recipe to duplicate builds. Image Builder image
				recipes can be shared, branched, and edited using the console wizard, the AWS CLI, or
				the API. You can use image recipes with your version control software to maintain
				shareable, versioned image recipes.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Container recipe</h6>
			<p>An Image Builder container recipe is a document that defines the base image and the
				components that are applied to the base image to produce the desired configuration
				for the output container image. You can use a container recipe to duplicate builds.
				You can share, branch, and edit Image Builder image recipes by using the console wizard, the
				AWS CLI, or the API. You can use container recipes with your version control software
				to maintain shareable, versioned container recipes.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Base image</h6>
			<p>The base image is the selected image and operating system used in your image or
				container recipe document, along with the components. The base image and the
				component definitions combined produce the desired configuration for the output
				image.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Components</h6>
			<p>A component defines the sequence of steps required to either customize an instance
				prior to image creation (a <b>build component</b>), or to
				test an instance that was launched from the created image (a <b>test component</b>).</p>
		 
		<p>A component is created from a declarative, plain-text YAML or JSON document that
			describes the runtime configuration for building and validating, or testing an instance
			that is produced by your pipeline. Components run on the instance using a component
			management application. The component management application parses the documents and
			runs the desired steps.</p>
		<p>After they are created, one or more components are grouped together using an image
			recipe or container recipe to define the plan for building and testing a virtual machine
			or container image. You can use public components that are owned and managed by AWS,
			or you can create your own. For more information about components, see <a href="./toe-component-manager.html">How Image Builder uses the AWS Task Orchestrator and Executor application to manage components</a>.</p>
		
		 
			<h6>Component document</h6>
			<p>A declarative, plain-text YAML or JSON document that describes configuration for a
				customization you can apply to your image. The document is used to create a build or
				test component.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Runtime stages</h6>
			<p>EC2 Image Builder has two runtime stages: <b>build</b> and
					<b>test</b>. Each runtime stage has one or more phases
				with configuration defined by the component document.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h6>Configuration phases</h6>
			<p>The following list shows the phases that run during the <b>build</b> and <b>test</b> stages:</p>
		 
		<div class="variablelist">
			<h6><em>Build stage:</em></h6>
			 
			 
		<dl>
				<dt><span class="term">Build phase</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An image pipeline begins with the build phase of the build stage when it
						runs. The base image is downloaded, and configuration that is specified for
						the build phase of the component is applied to build and launch an
						instance.</p>
				</dd>
			 
				<dt><span class="term">Validate phase</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>After Image Builder launches the instance and applies all of the build phase 
						customizations, the validation phase begins. During this phase, Image Builder ensures 
						that all of the customizations work as expected, based on the configuration that 
						the component specifies for the validate phase. If the instance validation 
						succeeds, Image Builder stops the instance, creates an image, and then continues 
						to the test stage.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl></div>
		<div class="variablelist">
			<h6><em>Test stage:</em></h6>
			 
			 
		<dl>
				<dt><span class="term">Test phase</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>During this phase, Image Builder launches an instance from the image that it created 
						after the validation phase completed successfully. Image Builder runs test components 
						during this phase to verify that the instance is healthy and functions as
						expected.</p>
				</dd>
			 
				<dt><span class="term">Container host test phase</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>After Image Builder runs the test phase for all of the components that you selected in the
						container recipe, Image Builder runs this phase for container workflows. The container host
						test phase can run additional tests that validate container management and
						custom runtime configurations.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl></div>
		
		 
			<h6>Workflow</h6>
			<p>Workflows define the sequence of steps that Image Builder performs 
				when it creates a new image. All images have build and test workflows. Containers 
				have an additional workflow for distribution.</p>
		 
		<div class="variablelist">
			<h6><em>Workflow types</em></h6>
			 
			 
			 
		<dl>
				<dt><span class="term"><code class="code">BUILD</code></span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Covers build stage configuration for every image created.</p>
				</dd>
			 
				<dt><span class="term"><code class="code">TEST</code></span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Covers test stage configuration for every image created.</p>
				</dd>
			 
				<dt><span class="term"><code class="code">DISTRIBUTION</code></span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Covers distribution workflow for container images.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl></div>
	 
		<h2 id="image-builder-pricing">Pricing</h2>
		<p>There is no cost to use EC2 Image Builder to create custom AMI or container images. However,
			standard pricing applies for other services that are used in the process. The following
			list includes the usage of some AWS services that can incur costs when you create,
