        you own (domains or email addresses) using their own Amazon SES accounts. With the
            <em>sending authorization</em> feature, you can maintain control over your
        identities so that you can change or revoke permissions at any time. For example, if you're
        a business owner, you can use sending authorization to enable a third party (such as an
        email marketing company) to send email from a domain you own.</p><p>This chapter covers the specifics of sending authorization which replaces the legacy
        cross-account notifications feature. You should first understand the basics of identity
        based authorization using authorization policies as explained in <a href="./identity-authorization-policies.html">Using identity authorization in
            Amazon SES</a> which covers important topics such as
        the anatomy of an authorization policy and how to manage your polices.</p>
        <h2 id="sending-authorization-cross-account-sunsetting">Cross-account
                notifications legacy support</h2>

        <p>Feedback notifications for bounces, complaints, and deliveries associated with email
            sent from a delegate sender that's been authorized by an identity owner to send from one
            of his verified identities, have traditionally been configured using cross-account
            notifications  where the delegate sender would
            associate a topic with an identity they didn't own (that’s the cross-account). However,
            cross-account notifications have been replaced by using configuration sets and verified
            identities in association with delegate sending where the delegate sender has been
            authorized by the identity owner to use one of their verified identities to send email
            from. This new method allows the flexibility to configure bounce, complaint, delivery,
            and other event notifications by the following two constructs depending if you're the
            delegate sender or the owner of the verified identity:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="topcom">Configuration sets</span> – The delegate sender
                    can set up event publishing in his own configuration set that he can specify
                    when sending email from a verified identity he doesn't own, but has been
                    authorized to send from by the identity owner through an authorization policy.
                    Event publishing allows bounce, complaint, delivery, and other event
                    notifications to be published to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon Pinpoint, and Amazon SNS. See
                        <a href="./event-destinations-manage.html">Create event
            destinations</a>.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="topcom">Verified identities</span> – Besides having the
                    identity owner authorize the delegate sender to use one of his verified
                    identities to send email from, he can also, at the request of the delegate
                    sender, configure feedback notifications on the shared identity to use
                    SNS topics owned by the delegate sender. Only the delegate sender will
                    get these notifications because they own the SNS topic. See Step 14 for
                    how to <a href="./sending-authorization-identity-owner-tasks-policy.html#configure-sns-topic-you-dont-own">configure an "SNS
                        topic you don't own"</a> in the authorization policy procedures.</p>

                cross-account notifications currently being used in your account. This support is
                limited to being able to modify and use any current cross-accounts you created in
                the Amazon SES classic console; however, you can no longer create
                    <em>new</em> cross-account notifications. To create new ones in the
                Amazon SES new console, use the new methods of delegate sending either with configuration
                sets using <a href="./event-destinations-manage.html">event publishing</a>, or
