Although Roles have been assigned, as a group we believe that all participants should be conversant in all roles.

How will the group ensure accountability and track progress.

GitHub for deadlines, sprints, Project management.

Meetings - minutes are kept. Assigned roles tracked. Progress is assessed and evaluated.

Version Control Strategy

Agile Strategies in GitHub for versioning.
Ensure merging contributions are managed with Pull Requests.

Pull requests are ideally evaluated but collaborators can merge their own branches if necessary due to time constraints or other factors.

Main Branch -- Feature Branch

Examples of good naming conventions:
/feature-feature-name
/bugfix-bug-name

Find good convetions

**Development Tools**
EC2 Aws Server for dev environment
IDE is whichever the user is comfortable with
CI/CD pipeline setup for Monday
GDB, AFL++Clang - I'll research the others. Ensure choices are well justified.
Cloud Development Pipeline for uniformity.
git and GitHub Repos
Communication tools as already discussed.

**Key Secure Coding Issues**
Ensuring all keys remain unpublished (.gitignore)
Principle of least privileges. As it pertains to linux users.
Clear demarcation between players, ,game administrators, developers, anyone else.
Password hashing pracitces - md5, others?
This is important.
why it is relevant to the project
•how it will be applied during development, and
•how the group will ensure it is effectively used.


**Risk Management and Quality Assurance**
Redundancy and backups. 
Ensure that CI/CD pipeline is robustly configured.
Time Machine Backups
Research windows backups.

**Standards**
C11 standards.
Peer Reviews
Pull requests are ideally evaluated but collaborators can merge their own branches if necessary due to time constraints or other factors.
Find good, explicit, publically available style guides.

### 5.7 Security Implementation Details

#### RBAC Implementation
1. **Role Hierarchy**
   ```c
   typedef enum {
       ROLE_PLAYER,
       ROLE_MODERATOR,
       ROLE_ADMIN,
       ROLE_SYSTEM
   } role_t;
   ```

2. **Permission Management**
   ```c
   typedef struct {
       role_t role;
       permission_t permissions;
       time_t valid_until;
   } access_token_t;
   ```

#### Session Management
1. **Token Generation**
   ```c
   typedef struct {
       char token[TOKEN_LENGTH];
       time_t issued_at;
       time_t expires_at;
       char session_id[SESSION_ID_LENGTH];
   } session_token_t;
   ```

2. **Security Measures**
   - Token rotation every 15 minutes
   - Concurrent session limit: 3
   - Session timeout: 30 minutes
   - IP-based session validation

#### Authentication System
1. **Password Policies**
   - Minimum length: 12 characters
   - Required character types: 3
   - Maximum age: 90 days
   - History: 5 previous passwords

2. **Account Recovery**
   - Security questions: 3 required
   - Recovery email verification
   - Temporary password expiration: 24 hours
   - Failed attempts limit: 5

### 5.8 Quality Metrics

#### Code Quality
- Cyclomatic complexity: < 10
- Function length: < 50 lines
- Comment density: > 20%
- Duplication: < 5%

#### Security Metrics
- Static analysis warnings: 0
- Memory leaks: 0
- Buffer overflows: 0
- Race conditions: 0

#### Testing Metrics
- Unit test coverage: > 90%
- Integration test coverage: > 80%
- Security test coverage: > 95%
- Performance test pass rate: 100%

### 5.9 Documentation Requirements

#### Code Documentation
1. **Function Headers**
   ```c
   /**
    * @brief Brief description
    * @param param1 Description of param1
    * @return Description of return value
    * @throws Description of error conditions
    * @note Any special considerations
    * @security Security implications
    * @performance Performance considerations
    */
   ```

2. **Security Documentation**
