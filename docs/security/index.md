# Security Documentation

This section covers all security-related aspects of the OO-ACS project, including authentication mechanisms, role-based access control (RBAC), and session management.

## Contents

- [Security Guide](security-guide.md): Comprehensive security implementation guide
- [CIA Triad](cia-triad.md): Core security principles and implementation

## Key Security Principles

- All authentication uses libsodium for cryptographic operations
- Zero-trust architecture principles are followed throughout
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Regular security audits and testing

## Security Components

### Authentication System
- Secure login mechanisms
- Password management using libsodium
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Account recovery procedures

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission management
- Access control lists
- Financial instrument access control

### Session Management
- Secure session handling
- Session timeout management
- Concurrent session control
- Suspicious activity detection

## Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Security audit procedures
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance verification
