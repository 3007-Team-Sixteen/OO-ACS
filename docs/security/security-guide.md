# Security Implementation Guide

This document details the security implementation standards and practices for OO-ACS.

## Authentication System
- Secure Login Implementation
- Password Management
- Multi-factor Authentication
- Session Handling

## Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Permission Management
- Access Control Lists
- Privilege Escalation Prevention

## Security Standards Implementation

- **CIA Triad:** Details on implementation in [CIA Triad Application](cia-triad.md).
- **Code Scanning:** Utilize static analysis tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities using Dependabot.
- **Secrets Management:** API keys and sensitive credentials managed via GitHub Secrets and secure environment variables.

## Secure Development Practices

- Follow SEI CERT C guidelines.
- Implement input validation and output encoding.
- Use secure memory management techniques.
- Adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## Automated System Repository Access (Deploy Keys)

- **Principle:** Automated systems (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts like Ansible) requiring access to the private GitHub repository MUST use unique SSH Deploy Keys.
- **Key Generation:** Keys (Ed25519 recommended) should be generated specifically for the service or server requiring access.
- **GitHub Configuration:** The public key MUST be added as a Deploy Key in the repository settings (Settings -> Deploy Keys). Read-only access is sufficient and recommended for cloning.
- **Security:** This ensures least privilege, isolating access credentials and preventing the use of personal SSH keys in automated systems. Private keys generated for deployment should remain securely on the target system.

## Monitoring and Auditing
- Security Logging
- Audit Trail Implementation
- Intrusion Detection
- Incident Response Procedures
